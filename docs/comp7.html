        <h3><u>Intro</u></h3>
        <p> To practice with using Git and familiarize myself with the website GitHub i have written my reflection in a simple HTML+CSS file.
             Which I have uploaded to GitHub and used Git to manage the version control.
            This enabled me to create this resource, where i can record any Git commands i've learnt, in addition to reflecting on the importance of version control.
        </p>
        <p>As Part of <em>Competency #7</em> I attended a lecture on software development,
        learning about some of the essential skills required to code in a highly dynamic space.
        I will proceed to briefly describe some of the content discussed below, 
        in addition to describing the importance and application of development cycles
        and version control within the NHS. I will also seek to reflect on the ways I will
        apply these during any software development I partake in.</p> 
    </div>
    <div id="Models" class="small">
        <h3><u>Models</u></h3>
        <p>The 2 models i will be comparing are listed below</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development" target="_blank"><strong>AGILE</strong></a></li>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model" target="_blank"><strong>Waterfall</strong></a></li>
        </ul>
        <p> the AGILE model is a development cycle that is designed to be integrated into large multi-disciplinary teams.
            Software development is broken into short goal driven sprints. A sprint can last from 1-4 weeks, and contains planing, development, and testing.
             The model promotes the use of constant communication. Meetings called 'SCRUMS' are a space for talking with stakeholders. 
        
        <p> <em> üëç Advantages of  AGILE </em> </p> 
         <ul>
            <li>Highly flexible and can adapt to suit the needs of the team, as it's iterative and incremental.</li>
            <li>Users and testing are involved throughout development so issues are quickly identified.</li>
         </ul>   
        <p> <em>üëé Disadvantages of AGILE </em> </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Difficult to manage as product creep may occur.</li>
            <li>Not always suitable for smaller teams or individuals working alone.</li>
        </ul> 
        <p> The Waterfall model is a linear approach to software development, a "think first code second", where requirements gathering and planning are completed beforehand.
            Each stage results in a fully fulfilled product, realizing the established goals and targets before the next cycle can begin.</p>
        <p> <em> üëé Disadvantages of Waterfall </em> </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Difficulty adapting to changing requirements and arising issues</li>
            <li>Stakeholders are not involved until the near end.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> <em> üëçAdvantages of Waterfall  </em></p>
        <ul>
            <li> Simply structured around achieving the final resulting product </li>
            <li> Perfect model for smaller teams and projects </li>
        </ul>
        <p> If I was to work with one model i would choose to focus on AGILE,
             as I believe it to be the better method because </p>

    <div id="Requriments gathering ">       
            <H3><em>Why do We need requirements gathering?</em></H3>   
            requirements gathering is the process of identifying the needs of the user, and then translating them into a set of requirements. T
            here are many different ways of doing this, and it is important to do it correctly, as it is crucial to the success of the project.

        <h2 id="Reflections">Final Reflections</h2>
            <p>In reflection a key part of working within a development environment is the use of tool such as version control, Development cycles, and requirements gathering.
                Therefor I am glad i have taken the time to learn these skills, and i believe they will be useful in the future.
                I have found that the most difficult part of this process was the use of GIT, as i have never used it before, and it is a very powerful tool.
                though, i am know a lot more confident in using it, and i am looking forward to applying my knowledge it in the future to gain more experience.
                I have also found that the use of a development cycle is very useful, as it allows me to keep track of my progress, and it also allows me to see what i have done, and what i need to do.
                this project got a bit out of hand and is a clear example of the importance of requirements gathering, as i started off with a simple website, but then i decided to add a lot more to it.
