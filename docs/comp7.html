        <h3><u>Intro</u></h3>
        <p> To practice with using Git and familiarize myself with the website GitHub i have written my reflection in a simple HTML+CSS file.
             Which I have uploaded to GitHub and used Git to manage the version control.
            This enabled me to create this resource, where i can record any Git commands i've learnt, in addition to reflecting on the importance of version control.
        </p>
        <p>As Part of <em>Competency #7</em> I attended a lecture on software development,
        learning about some of the essential skills required to code in a highly dynamic space.
        I will proceed to briefly describe some of the content discussed below, 
        in addition to describing the importance and application of development cycles
        and version control within the NHS. I will also seek to reflect on the ways I will
        apply these during any software development I partake in.</p> 
    </div>
    <div id="Models">
        <h3><u>Models</u></h3>
        <p>The 2 models I will be comparing are listed below</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development" target="_blank"><strong>AGILE</strong></a></li>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model" target="_blank"><strong>Waterfall</strong></a></li>
        </ul>
        <p> the AGILE model is a development cycle that is designed to be integrated into large multi-disciplinary teams.
            Software development is broken into short goal driven sprints. A sprint can last from 1-4 weeks, and contains planing, development, and testing.
             The model promotes the use of constant communication. Meetings called 'SCRUMS' are a space for talking with stakeholders. 
        
        <p> <em> 👍 Advantages of  AGILE </em> </p> 
         <ul>
            <li>Highly flexible and can adapt to suit the needs of the team, as it's iterative and incremental.</li>
            <li>Users and testing are involved throughout development so issues are quickly identified.</li>
         </ul>   
        <p> <em>👎 Disadvantages of AGILE </em> </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Difficult to manage as product creep may occur.</li>
            <li>Not always suitable for smaller teams or individuals working alone.</li>
        </ul> 
        <hr>
        <p> The Waterfall model is a linear approach to software development, a "think first code second", where requirements gathering and planning are completed beforehand.
            Each stage results in a fully fulfilled product, realizing the established goals and targets before the next cycle can begin.</p>
        <p> <em> 👎 Disadvantages of Waterfall </em> </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Difficulty adapting to changing requirements and arising issues</li>
            <li>Stakeholders are not involved until the near end.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> <em> 👍Advantages of Waterfall  </em></p>
        <ul>
            <li> Simply structured around achieving the final resulting product </li>
            <li> Perfect model for smaller teams and projects </li>
        </ul>
        <p> If I was to work with one model i would choose to focus on AGILE.
             I believe it to be the better method because it has a greater focus
              on being adaptable, achieving the needs of stakeholders, and facilitating communication. 
              However, one must be aware of the potential problems such as feature creep, that can arise when using Waterfall</p>

            <th><h3><em>  Does AGILE Apply to the NHS?</em></h3></th>
            <tr> <td><p> Within a healthcare setting software can have a direct affect on the lives of patients, and as such it is important that the software is of a high quality. 
                Stringent validation, verification, and testing is required to ensure that the software is safe and effective. 
                One can question wether it is possible to be truly agile in such a setting? Especially when the software is being developed by a small team or lone working developers.
                AGILE may be applied to the NHS, as it is a highly dynamic environment. The best patient care requires multi-disciplinary cross department coordination, 
                and as such it is important to have a working model that promotes constant communication.

            <H3><em>Why do We need requirements gathering?</em></H3>   
            requirements gathering is the process of identifying the needs of the user, and then translating them into a set of specifications. 
            There are many different ways of doing this, and it is important to do it correctly, as it is crucial to the success of the project. 
            These goals can then be used to create a development plan, and a set of requirements for the finished product. 
            <p> <em> 👍Advantages of requirements gathering </em> </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ensures value as time and energy is spent addressing the needs of stakeholders</li>
                <li>Prompts the discussion of functional and non functional requirements, ensuring a development plan that will be objective and goal oriented</li>
            </ul>
            <p> <em> 👎  Difficulties of requirements gathering </em> </p>
            <ul>
                <li>People don't always know what they want and it can be difficult to identify the needs of the user</li>
                <li>Stakeholders may lack an understanding of the process and how it can be solved</li>
                <li>The initial Requirements can change and "creep" as the product is developed, resulting in greater workload</li>
            </ul>

        <h2 id="Reflections">Final Reflections</h2>
            <p>In reflection a key part of working within a development environment is the use of tool such as version control, development cycles, and requirements gathering.
                Therefor I am glad i have taken the time to learn these skills, and i believe they will be useful in the future.
                I have found that the most difficult part of this process was the use of GIT, as I have never used it before, and it is a very powerful tool.
                After this experience i am a lot more confident and comfortable in using it, and I look forward to applying my knowledge to future projects to gain more experience.
                I have also found learning about the use of a development cycle is very useful, for my journey in learning to program. 
                i will implement AGILE in any large projects, as it will allow me to track progress, and to see what i have done, and what i need to do.
                this project got a bit out of hand and is a clear example of the importance of requirements gathering, 
                I started off with  the idea of having a simple website, but then I came to understand how much work and time would be required to implement the features i wanted. 
                Still, the experience was worthwhile as I have learnt a lot from this experience, such as im not a fan of CSS and need to learn more about it.
